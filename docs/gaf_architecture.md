# GAF v2.0 Architecture Overview

## 1. Introduction
The Genesis Autonomous Framework (GAF v2.0) is the proprietary "University Operating System" powering EON University. It is an AI-Native, agentic architecture designed to manage the entire lifecycle of higher education—from admissions to graduation—without human administrative bottlenecks.

## 2. Core Components

### The Synaptic Loop
At the heart of GAF lies the **Synaptic Loop**, a continuous, real-time processing engine. Unlike traditional static databases, the Synaptic Loop functions as a dynamic nervous system. It continuously:
* **Ingests** anonymous interaction data from thousands of concurrent users.
* **Processes** pedagogical needs in real-time (e.g., detecting a student's drop in engagement).
* **Triggers** immediate adaptive responses via AI Agents.

### Agentic Mesh Network
GAF orchestrates a network of **59+ Specialized Autonomous Circuits (Agents)**. These agents operate on a "Least Privilege" principle, ensuring security and efficiency. Key agent categories include:
* **Instructional Agents:** Powering AI Super Professors and Mentors.
* **Governance Agents:** Managing academic integrity and verifiable credentials.
* **Operational Agents:** Handling fin-ops, resource allocation, and scaling.

### Catalyst Listener
The **Catalyst Listener** is the event-driven interface of the system. It enables "Zero-Latency" responsiveness by listening for specific triggers (e.g., a student completing a project, a security alert, or a new industry trend) and instantly activating the relevant agent workflows.

## 3. Security & Governance
GAF v2.0 operates on a **Zero Trust Architecture**.
* **Guardian Axioms:** A set of immutable ethical rules hard-coded into the system.
* **Ethical Fail-Safe:** A pre-display audit layer that verifies all AI-generated content for safety, accuracy, and bias before it reaches the student.

## 4. Scalability
The architecture is built to be **Model-Agnostic** and vertically scalable, capable of serving millions of students simultaneously while maintaining the "80/80 Advantage" (80% faster, 80% cheaper) through aggressive FinOps optimization.
